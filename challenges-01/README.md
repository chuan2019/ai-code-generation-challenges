# AI Code Challenge #1 - CLI ToDo Application

## Goal

Build a simple **CLI ToDo application in a programming language you're unfamiliar with** - using a LLM to help you every step of the way.

## The Challenge

Build a ToDo app that supports:

- Adding tasks
- Deleting tasks
- Marking tasks complete/incomplete
- Optional: Saving data locally (file/database)
- Optional: Add a GUI

## Rules

1. Pick a language you've never (or barely) used. Examples: Rust, Go, Kotlin, Clojure, Dart, Haskell, JavaScript, Zig, Odin, etc.
2. Use an LLM as your coding pair. Examples: ChatGPT, Github Copilot, Cursor, etc.
3. Focus on learning idiomatic patterns, syntax, and tooling.

## Tips & Tricks

1. Break it into steps.
Ask: "How do I set up a project in X?" -> "How do I define a task struct/class?" -> "How do I handle input/output?"

2. Ask for idiomatic code.
Prompt: "Can you write idiomatic Go code for a basic CLI app that manages tasks?"

3. Ask for explanations.
If something looks confusing, prompt:
"Explain what this line does."
"Why use a map here instead of a struct?"

4. Use playgrounds and REPLs.
They let you run code quickly without setting up a full dev environment.
Examples:
- [Go Playground](https://go.dev/play)
- [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2024)
- [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev)
- [Scastie](https://scastie.scala-lang.org)

5. Ask for project scaffolding.
Prompt: "Create a minimal project structure in Kotlin for a CLI ToDo app."

6. Refactor and review.
Once it works, ask: "Can this be refactored to follow best practices in this language?"

7. Translate from one language to another.
Write the app in a language you know and ask the LLM to translate it into the target language.
