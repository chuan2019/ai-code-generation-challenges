chuan2019: Please help update the MyWork.md file based on my two requests in the chat above

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you update the `MyWork.md` file to document the two completed iterations based on our conversation. Let me update the sections for "Iteration 2: Add Test Cases" and "Iteration 3: Fix Regression Bug". 
```
MyWork.md+86-1
```

Perfect! I've updated your `MyWork.md` file to document both iterations based on our conversation:

## ✅ Iteration 2: Add Test Cases
- Comprehensive documentation of the 50+ test suite implementation
- Details about the 4 test categories (TaskSpec, TodoManagerSpec, Integration, CLI)
- Test infrastructure including runner script and GitHub Actions
- Usage commands and learning outcomes

## ✅ Iteration 3: Fix Regression Bug  
- Complete documentation of the compilation issue and resolution process
- Root cause analysis of the manual edits that broke the code
- Step-by-step debugging and fixing process
- Verification steps and prevention measures
- Key learning outcomes about regression testing and development workflow

The documentation now provides a complete record of your development journey, showing how you:
1. Built the initial Todo CLI application
2. Added comprehensive test coverage to prevent regressions  
3. Successfully debugged and fixed compilation issues when they occurred

This creates a valuable reference for future development and demonstrates the importance of having a robust test suite to catch and resolve issues quickly.
