# AI Code Generation Challenges

A collection of coding challenges designed to explore AI-assisted development across different programming languages and domains.

## Table of Contents

### [Challenge #1 - CLI ToDo Application](./challenges-01/)
Build a simple **CLI ToDo application in a programming language you're unfamiliar with** using an LLM as your coding partner.

**Key Features:**
- Adding tasks
- Deleting tasks  
- Marking tasks complete/incomplete
- Optional: Data persistence
- Optional: GUI interface

**Tech Stack:** Scala (or any unfamiliar language)

### [Challenge #2 - Breakout Game](./challenges-02/)
Build a **Breakout-style game in under 1 hour** with AI assistance, using only copy & paste for code editing.

**Key Features:**
- Ball physics with bouncing
- Player-controlled paddle
- Destructible bricks
- Life and scoring system
- Optional: Level progression

**Tech Stack:** Python with Pygame

### [Challenge #3 - Procedural Generation with Wave Function Collapse](./challenges-03/)
Implement the **Wave Function Collapse algorithm** to create a procedural content generator with AI as your coding partner.

**Key Features:**
- Wave Function Collapse algorithm implementation
- Constraint-based tile placement
- Pattern generation from sample input
- Emergent level/texture creation
- Optional: Multiple output formats

**Tech Stack:** TBD (to be determined based on AI recommendations)

### [Challenge #4 - Real-time 3D Renderer](./challenges-04/)
Build a **simple real-time 3D renderer with a floating object and movable light** using an LLM as your coding partner.

**Key Features:**
- Animated floating sphere (sine wave motion)
- Interactive point light source
- Real-time lighting and shading
- Interactive light movement (gizmo/keys/UI)
- Optional: Multiple lights, custom shaders

**Tech Stack:** Rust + Bevy, Go + Ebiten, Python + moderngl, JavaScript + Three.js, or C++ + OpenGL
